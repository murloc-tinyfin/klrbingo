            <ol>
                <li>
                Favorite song and game must be your actual favorite. No cheating. I will make a list of favorites if need be!
                </li>
                <li>
                You have to gain 300 xp on top of the xp you already have on the leaderboard for each card that contains that space. When you achieve the 300 xp you must annouce it to the chat.
                </li>
                <li>
                For matching theme if a song from a game plays while that game is in the gameplay corner it checks that space, it doesn't have to be the specific song matching the level of the gameplay.
                </li>
                <li>
                For specific song remixes are allowed. For example CROWNED remixes count. It has to be an individual remix, for example Rendezvous of the King and the Witches from cafe doesn't count as a remix of CROWNED. But for songs from a game remixes from future games are not counted.
                </li>
                <li>
                Songs from remakes of games count for the original game, so Adventure counts for Nightmare in Dreamland and vice versa.
                </li>
                <li>
                If there are are any questions or concerns let us know. Suggestions for bingo spaces are also accepted.
                </li>
                <li>
                Most importantly, have fun!
                </li>
